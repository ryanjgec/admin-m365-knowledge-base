(gen_random_uuid(), 'Implementing Conditional Access Policies',
'Conditional Access is Azure AD''s tool for bringing signals together, making decisions, and enforcing organizational policies.

## What is Conditional Access?

Conditional Access policies are if-then statements: if a user wants to access a resource, then they must complete an action.

## Key Components

### Signals
- User or group membership
- IP location information
- Device information
- Application information
- Real-time risk detection

### Decisions
- Block access
- Grant access
- Grant access with requirements (MFA, compliant device, etc.)

## Common Policy Scenarios

### Require MFA for Admins
```
IF user is in "Global Administrators" group
THEN require multi-factor authentication
```

### Block Legacy Authentication
```
IF authentication protocol is legacy (IMAP, POP, SMTP)
THEN block access
```

### Require Compliant Devices
```
IF user accesses Office 365 apps
AND device is not compliant
THEN block access
```

## Implementation Best Practices

1. **Start with Report-only Mode**: Test policies without enforcement
2. **Use Exclusions Carefully**: Always exclude emergency access accounts
3. **Layer Policies**: Combine multiple conditions for robust security
4. **Monitor Continuously**: Review sign-in logs and policy effectiveness

## Policy Creation Process

1. Navigate to Azure AD > Security > Conditional Access
2. Create new policy or clone existing one
3. Configure assignments (users, apps, conditions)
4. Set access controls (grant/block)
5. Enable policy in report-only mode first
6. Monitor and adjust before full enforcement

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:
- **Locked out users**: Use emergency access accounts
- **Policy conflicts**: Review policy precedence
- **Performance impact**: Optimize policy conditions

(gen_random_uuid(), 'SharePoint Permission Management Best Practices',
'Effective permission management in SharePoint Online is crucial for maintaining security while enabling collaboration.

## SharePoint Permission Model

### Permission Levels
- **Full Control**: Complete access to site and content
- **Design**: Modify site structure and appearance
- **Edit**: Add, edit, and delete content
- **Contribute**: Add and edit content, cannot delete
- **Read**: View-only access to content

### SharePoint Groups
- **Site Owners**: Full control over the site
- **Site Members**: Contribute to site content
- **Site Visitors**: Read-only access

## Best Practices for Permission Management

### 1. Use SharePoint Groups Instead of Individual Permissions
```
‚úÖ Good: Add users to "Marketing Team Members" group
‚ùå Bad: Grant individual permissions to each user
```

### 2. Implement Least Privilege Principle
- Grant minimum permissions necessary
- Regularly review and audit permissions
- Remove access when no longer needed

### 3. Use Azure AD Groups for Large Organizations
- Sync on-premises groups to Azure AD
- Use dynamic groups for automatic membership
- Leverage nested groups for complex hierarchies

## Permission Inheritance

### Understanding Inheritance
- Sites inherit from site collection
- Lists inherit from sites
- Items inherit from lists
- Breaking inheritance creates unique permissions

### When to Break Inheritance
- Confidential documents requiring restricted access
- Department-specific content
- Executive or HR materials

## Advanced Permission Scenarios

### External Sharing
Configure external sharing at multiple levels:
1. **Tenant level**: Organization-wide policies
2. **Site collection level**: Site-specific restrictions
3. **Site level**: Individual site settings
4. **Item level**: Document-specific sharing

### Conditional Access Integration
Combine SharePoint permissions with Conditional Access:
- Require MFA for sensitive sites
- Block access from unmanaged devices
- Restrict access by location

## Monitoring and Auditing

### Regular Permission Reviews
- Monthly review of site owners
- Quarterly audit of external sharing
- Annual comprehensive permission review

### Using SharePoint Admin Center
Monitor sharing activities:
- Active sites report
- Sharing reports
- Access requests

### PowerShell for Bulk Operations
```powershell
# Get all site permissions
Get-PnPSiteGroup | Get-PnPGroupMember

# Remove user from all sites
Remove-PnPUser -Identity "user@domain.com"
```

## Common Permission Issues

### Problem: Users Can''t Access Content
**Solutions:**
- Check permission inheritance
- Verify group membership
- Review Conditional Access policies

### Problem: Too Many Permission Requests
**Solutions:**
- Implement self-service access
- Use Azure AD groups
- Provide clear access guidelines

(gen_random_uuid(), 'Advanced Threat Hunting with Microsoft 365 Defender',
'Microsoft 365 Defender provides advanced threat hunting capabilities using KQL (Kusto Query Language) to proactively search for threats across your environment.

## Introduction to Threat Hunting

Threat hunting is the proactive search for cyber threats that may have evaded traditional security measures. Microsoft 365 Defender provides a unified platform for hunting across:

- Microsoft Defender for Endpoint
- Microsoft Defender for Office 365
- Microsoft Defender for Identity
- Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps

## Getting Started with Advanced Hunting

### Accessing Advanced Hunting
1. Navigate to Microsoft 365 Defender portal
2. Go to Hunting > Advanced hunting
3. Use the query editor to write KQL queries

### Basic KQL Syntax
```kql
// Basic table query
DeviceEvents
| where Timestamp > ago(7d)
| where ActionType == "ProcessCreated"
| limit 100
```

## Common Hunting Scenarios

### 1. Suspicious PowerShell Activity
```kql
DeviceProcessEvents
| where Timestamp > ago(30d)
| where FileName =~ "powershell.exe"
| where ProcessCommandLine contains "-enc" or ProcessCommandLine contains "-encoded"
| where ProcessCommandLine contains "bypass" or ProcessCommandLine contains "hidden"
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, ProcessCommandLine, InitiatingProcessFileName
| order by Timestamp desc
```

### 2. Unusual Sign-in Patterns
```kql
SigninLogs
| where TimeGenerated > ago(7d)
| where RiskLevelDuringSignIn == "high"
| summarize SigninCount = count() by UserPrincipalName, Location, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| where SigninCount > 5
| order by SigninCount desc
```

### 3. Email-based Threats
```kql
EmailEvents
| where Timestamp > ago(7d)
| where ThreatTypes has "Phish" or ThreatTypes has "Malware"
| join EmailAttachmentInfo on NetworkMessageId
| project Timestamp, SenderFromAddress, RecipientEmailAddress, Subject, FileName, FileType
| order by Timestamp desc
```

### 4. Lateral Movement Detection
```kql
DeviceLogonEvents
| where Timestamp > ago(24h)
| where LogonType == "Network"
| summarize LogonCount = count(), UniqueDevices = dcount(DeviceName) by AccountName, bin(Timestamp, 1h)
| where UniqueDevices > 5
| order by LogonCount desc
```

## Advanced Hunting Techniques

### 1. Cross-Domain Correlation
```kql
let SuspiciousIPs = 
    DeviceNetworkEvents
    | where Timestamp > ago(7d)
    | where RemoteIPType == "Public"
    | summarize ConnectionCount = count() by RemoteIP
    | where ConnectionCount > 100
    | project RemoteIP;
//
EmailEvents
| where Timestamp > ago(7d)
| where SenderIPv4 in (SuspiciousIPs)
| project Timestamp, SenderFromAddress, RecipientEmailAddress, Subject, SenderIPv4
```

### 2. Behavioral Analysis
```kql
DeviceFileEvents
| where Timestamp > ago(30d)
| where ActionType == "FileCreated"
| where FolderPath startswith @"C:\Users\" and FolderPath endswith @"\AppData\Roaming\"
| summarize FileCount = count(), UniqueFiles = dcount(FileName) by DeviceName, InitiatingProcessFileName, bin(Timestamp, 1d)
| where FileCount > 50
| order by FileCount desc
```

## Building Custom Detection Rules

### Creating Detection Rules from Queries
1. Develop and test your KQL query
2. Click "Create detection rule" in the query editor
3. Configure rule settings:
   - Rule name and description
   - Frequency (every 5 minutes to 24 hours)
   - Alert threshold
   - Suppression settings

### Example Detection Rule
```kql
// Detect potential credential dumping
DeviceProcessEvents
| where Timestamp > ago(5m)
| where ProcessCommandLine has_any ("sekurlsa", "logonpasswords", "lsadump")
| where InitiatingProcessFileName !in ("powershell_ise.exe", "SecurityHealthService.exe")
```

## Threat Hunting Best Practices

### 1. Start with Hypothesis
- Define what you''re looking for
- Base hunts on threat intelligence
- Focus on high-value assets

### 2. Use Threat Intelligence
- Incorporate IOCs from threat feeds
- Leverage MITRE ATT&CK framework
- Stay updated on current threats

### 3. Optimize Query Performance
- Use time filters to limit data scope
- Filter early in the query pipeline
- Use summarize operations efficiently

### 4. Document and Share Findings
- Create playbooks for common hunts
- Share successful queries with team
- Document false positives to improve queries

## Integration with Other Tools

### Microsoft Sentinel Integration
- Export hunting queries to Sentinel
- Use Sentinel workbooks for visualization
- Leverage Sentinel''s ML capabilities

### Threat Intelligence Platforms
- Import IOCs into custom detection rules
- Correlate findings with external threat data
- Automate threat hunting based on new intelligence
